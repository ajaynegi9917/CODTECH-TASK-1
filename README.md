This project is a simple retrieval-based chatbot built in Python using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and Scikit-learn, designed to answer common questions related to Natural Language Processing (NLP), NLTK, and chatbots. Instead of using complex deep learning models, this chatbot relies on traditional text processing and information retrieval techniques, making it lightweight, fast, and easy to implement. The system works by defining a set of question-answer pairs, which act as the chatbot’s knowledge base. User input is first preprocessed using NLTK, where the text is converted to lowercase, punctuation is removed, and words are tokenized and lemmatized to reduce them to their root forms. This ensures consistency and improves the accuracy of matching. Once cleaned, both the stored questions and user queries are transformed into numerical representations using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency), a method that assigns weights to words based on how frequently they occur across all questions while reducing the influence of common stop words. With all questions stored as vectors, the chatbot then computes the cosine similarity between the user’s query vector and each stored question vector, identifying the one with the highest similarity score. If the score exceeds a certain threshold, the chatbot provides the corresponding answer. If the similarity is low, it suggests a few closely related questions to guide the user. Additionally, the chatbot handles direct matches efficiently, meaning if a user types a question exactly as it exists in the knowledge base, the answer is returned immediately without performing similarity calculations. To improve usability, it also recognizes exit commands such as “exit”, “quit”, or “bye” and terminates the session politely. The chatbot demonstrates how TF-IDF and cosine similarity can be effectively used for text retrieval tasks and shows the importance of preprocessing techniques like tokenization and lemmatization in natural language processing. The implementation uses Python 3, NLTK for linguistic preprocessing, and Scikit-learn for vectorization and similarity computation. It is simple to extend—new questions and answers can be added to the dictionary to grow its knowledge base, and thresholds can be tuned to balance between accuracy and flexibility. Some of the strengths of this project include its clarity, educational value, and ease of customization, making it an excellent starting point for beginners who want to understand how retrieval-based chatbots function. While limited to predefined knowledge, it runs quickly and efficiently without requiring heavy resources or training data. Future improvements could include expanding the question bank, adding memory for handling follow-up conversations, developing a web-based or GUI interface for better user interaction, or integrating modern embedding techniques such as Word2Vec, BERT, or GPT for more advanced semantic understanding. In conclusion, this project illustrates how simple natural language processing techniques combined with vector space models can create a functional chatbot capable of responding to user queries, serving both as a practical tool and a learning project for anyone interested in NLP, machine learning, and conversational AI.
